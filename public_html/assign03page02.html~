        <h1>Finally Knighted</h1>
        <p>The acclaimed Robert from Yorkshire was finally knighted last
           weekend. Most are confident in Robert's future success as a full 
           fledged knight due to his excellent performance in training. Yet,             
           experts are skeptical because of the ever changing behaviours of 
           dragons. These changes are making factors in young knights we used 
           to gauge success in the past meaningless. The public must hope
           that Sir Robert remain adaptive, flexible and willing to learn
           new skills as he has in the past.</p>

        <h1>Dragon Scare in Forestshire</h1>
        <p>Last wednessday on the outskirts of Forestshire, a big commotion
           stirred among nearby residents. A large purple dragon was first
           spotted by a local farm boy and hurredly reported the concern to the 
           local knights lounging in the nearest town tavern. They reacted
           promptly but were alarmed when the dragon seemed to ignore
           their response to its supposed attack. It would seem the dragon
           had no intent to attack and was preoccupied by something else.
           Who knows what.</p>

        <h1>Major dragon attack: city burned completely</h1>
        <p>The city of Foxland has once again been attacked by dragon fire
           for the 5th time this year. Experts conclude the skyrocketing 
           number of attacks are due to low numbers of knights in the Eastern
           Region. Foxland has been most effected by the shortage. The Eastern
           Region Council of the Round Table has resolved to protect cities
           by various methods which the came up with in a meeting by 
           brainstorming. It is believed they're forced to use other methods
           than knights because they're increasingly becoming more expensive
           to employ.</p>
