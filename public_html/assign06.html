           just right.</p><br>
        
         <p class="content">I love this picture and I find it pleasing to the eye. The foreground, formed
            by a marble fence and bright bushes, constrasts well with the darker willow tree in the
            background. The rainbow-like bows give a dramatic touch.</p><br>

            the photo may not follow any photography conventions, I hope you find
            joy in the simple things in life like a river.</p>

        <p class="content">The variety of colors we see during the fall always fascinate me. I look and
           look and I can't get enough. I think that's why I've been drawn to draw
           leaves and all stuctures found in the plant kingdom. I feel a need to draw something in order to understand it
           better.</p>

       <p class="content">I like how the tree on the left is serving as a frame for the side
            it sits on. I could do without the flood-control dam in the foreground.
            There's probably too much sky to follow the rule of thirds rule. Overall,
            there's not a whole lot going on to make it interesting.</p><br>

        <br><p class="content">In the garden at BYU - Idaho, there is a structure which appears
            to be a gate of some kind. I apologize for not taking the time to
            research the exact name. I especially enjoy the pots of plants in the foreground.
            Be cationed as the sun may hurt your eyes as I direct your attention to it. What
            would impove this photo is if the contrast of dark and light was toned down.</p>
